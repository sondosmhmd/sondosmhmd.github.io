                <p><span>The Volkswagen Golf</span> is a compact car/small family car (C-segment) produced by the German automotive manufacturer Volkswagen since 1974, marketed worldwide across eight generations, in various body configurations and under various nameplates including as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada (Mk1 and Mk5), and as the Volkswagen Caribe[1] in Mexico (Mk1).

                    The original Golf Mk1 was a front-engined,front-wheel drive replacement for the air-cooled, rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle. Historically, the Golf is Volkswagen's best-selling model and is among the world's top three best-selling models, with more than 35 million units sold as of 2019.

            <p><span>The Polo</span> is a compact car, with a traditional transversely mounted engine and front-wheel drive. Mk1 Polos only came with four-cylinder petrol engines, but for the Mk2, a diesel engine was offered for the first time, although only in certain markets, others having to wait until the launch of the Mk3. The current range includes a variety of three- and four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.

                Early versions used a four-speed manual transmission, whilst the current car is available with either six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic transmission. The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent MacPherson strut front suspension, and a twist-beam rear suspension. Most models use disc brakes at the front and rear drum brakes, although some recent models have all-round disc brakes.

                <span>The Volkswagen Up</span> (stylized as Volkswagen up!) is a city car produced by the Volkswagen Group from 2011 to 2023. It was unveiled at the 2011 International Motor Show Germany (IAA). Production of the Up started with the model year of 2012, in December 2011 at the Volkswagen Plant in Bratislava, Slovakia. It is part of the New Small Family (NSF) series of models, alongside the SEAT Mii and Škoda Citigo which are rebadged versions of the Up, with slightly different front and rear fascias. The SEAT and Škoda versions were manufactured in the same factory, before being withdrawn from sale in 2021 and 2020 respectively. Production of the Up ended in October 2023. A battery electric version, called E-up, was launched in autumn 2013.

               <span> The Volkswagen ID.4 and ID.5 </span>are battery electric compact crossover SUVs produced by Volkswagen. Based on the MEB platform, the ID.4 is the second model of the Volkswagen ID. series. The production version of the ID.4 debuted in September 2020 as the first fully-electric crossover SUV under the Volkswagen brand, while the coupe-shaped variant of the ID.4 (akin to the Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron) is marketed as the Volkswagen ID.5 and was revealed in November 2021.

The ID.4 is positioned by Volkswagen as a high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle — a car for "the millions, not the millionaires," as the company claimed in its advertising. It was delivered to European customers from late 2020, and the first quarter of 2021 for the North American market.

The ID.4 was elected World Car of the Year 2021 over runner-ups Honda e and Toyota Yaris.

The vehicle was updated for the 2024 model year; this includes a new, more powerful electric motor.
